## Overview

Apex Libraries used for standardized, scaled development on the Salesforce platform. The overall goal for this framework is to afford a package-development-friendly way for providing consistent libraries across one or many orgs. Additionally, this package aims to support a robust, integrated, and configurable set of tooling that allows the engagement of both Salesforce developers and administrators.

## Features of the Library

- Flexible configuration-driven trigger framework
- Testing utilities for mocking data and classes
- Enhanced DML for easy flexible secure-by-default dml operations
